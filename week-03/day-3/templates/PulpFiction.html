    <p class="body1">Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) and Vincent Vega (John Travolta) are 
        two hit men who are out to retrieve a suitcase stolen from their employer, mob boss 
        Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). Wallace has also asked Vincent to take his wife 
        Mia (Uma Thurman) out a few days later when Wallace himself will be out of town. Butch 
        Coolidge (Bruce Willis) is an aging boxer who is paid by Wallace to lose his fight. The 
        lives of these seemingly unrelated people are woven together comprising of a series of 
        funny, bizarre and uncalled-for incidents.</p>
